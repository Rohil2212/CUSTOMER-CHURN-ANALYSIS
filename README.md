Hello! My name is Rohil Bhingarde and in this repository, I have added a R project I did during my Fall Semester in Lehigh University. The R project is based on analyzing the Customer Churn of a Telesystems company and the factors that influence them. I have attached my project code and report in the files above. Feel free to have a look at it!
